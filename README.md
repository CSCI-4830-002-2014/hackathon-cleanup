# Objective 2. Clean up the Musician Dataset

Based on our visualization, there was no spike in musicians dying at the age of 27, but there was a spike at 26. The tutorial told us to only extract the year from the year of death and year of birth which causes a problem. There was a spike at age 26 and some of those could be age 27 since the months did not come into the calculation.
