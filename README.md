# Objective 2. Clean up the Muscian Dataset

After cleaning the data we show a plot of the approximate age of musician's deaths.  It is quite clear that there is no peak or statistical significance to deaths at the age of 27, with it not even showing as a local maximum.  The global maximum occurs at 61, which seems logical with more deaths occuring at advancing ages (and granted the data references into the early 1800s).
